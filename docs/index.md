# *Hoos on Task*

*Hoos on Task* was a semester-long project on Human-Computer Interfaces at the University of Virginia.

The course taken was CS 3205 (HCI) taught by [Panagiotis Apostellis](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/panagiotis-apostolellis).

## Goal

Group work in school projects **sucks**. Group member doing nothing, unclear communication and a lack of transparency all contribute to this problem. 

**Hoos on Task** provides organizational tools for students and management tools for professors. 

## Problems

**Student**

- Turning group chats into **actionable items** is difficult
- Scheduling meetings is difficult
- Communication on behalf of your group is non-obvious
- Deadlines are hard to keep track of

**Professors**

- Confrontational methods of group evaluation
    - [CateME Evaluation](https://info.catme.org/features/peer-evaluation/) feel like playing [the Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma)
